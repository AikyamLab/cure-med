Touch is carried by myelinated fibers, which are faster — *fiber mai sauri mai myelinated*.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nOption A states that touch information is transmitted via these fast myelinated fibers, which means that the brain receives touch signals more efficiently than pain signals.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nPain sensation, on the other hand, is often transmitted through unmyelinated fibers, which are slower. This could explain why the area of loss for touch is larger — *yankin asarar taɓawa yana da girma fiye da yankin asarar jin zafi*.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nLooking at the other options, B suggests that touch receptors are faster, which aligns with the myelinated fiber concept.

D states that in the primary sensory cortex, touch is represented in a larger area, which could also contribute to the perception of touch loss being more significant.\n</step6>\n<step7>\nThus, the most compelling reason is that touch is carried by faster myelinated fibers, leading to a larger area of loss when a spinal nerve root is injured.\n</step7></thinking>", "answer": "<answer>Saboda ana ɗaukar bayanan taɓawa ta hanyar fiber mai sauri mai myelinated, yankin asarar taɓawa yana da girma fiye da yankin asarar jin zafi.</answer>", "language": "Hausa"}

A TSH level of 4.7 µU/mL is within the normal range, but on the higher side, indicating that the thyroid is being stimulated to produce more hormones.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nThe low T3 level suggests that the thyroid is not producing enough of this hormone, which is crucial for metabolism — *metabolisme*. This could be due to the patient's recent illness affecting thyroid function.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nIn such cases, *hormone replacement therapy* might be considered. The most common treatment would involve increasing the levels of T4, which can convert to T3 in the body.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nTherefore, administering levothyroxine, a synthetic form of T4, could help raise the T3 levels indirectly. This is because T4 is converted to T3 in peripheral tissues.\n</step5>\n<step6>\nAdditionally, monitoring the patient's response to treatment is essential, as adjustments may be needed based on follow-up tests.\n</step6>\n<step7>\nIn summary, the patient may benefit from increasing the T4 levels to help elevate T3 levels, addressing the underlying issue of low thyroid hormone production.\n</step7></thinking>", "answer": "<answer>Majiyyacin na iya samun ƙarin matakin hormone T4 ta hanyar maganin levothyroxine don inganta matakin T3.</answer>", "language": "Hausa"}

Torque (T) is calculated as T = F × r, where F is the force applied and r is the radius of the disk.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nGiven the torque of 400 inch-pounds, we can rearrange the formula to find the force: F = T / r. The radius will vary depending on the size of the disk we choose, which must be between 3 inches and 5 inches.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nIf we take the maximum radius of 5 inches, the force would be F = 400 / 5 = 80 pounds.
