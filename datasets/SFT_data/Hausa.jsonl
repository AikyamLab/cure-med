So, 2 mm is equal to 0.2 cm.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nNext, we use the formula for the probability of interaction, which is given by: *P = 1 - e^(-nσx)*, where *n* is the number density of target nuclei, *σ* is the cross-section in barns, and *x* is the thickness in centimeters.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nTo find *n*, we need the density of silver, which is approximately 10.49 g/cm³, and the atomic mass of silver is about 107.87 g/mol. Thus, we can calculate *n* using Avogadro's number: *n = (density / atomic mass) × Avogadro's number*.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nCalculating this gives us *n ≈ (10.49 g/cm³ / 107.87 g/mol) × 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹*, which results in a number density of approximately 5.83 × 10²² nuclei/cm³.\n</step5>\n<step6>\nNow, substituting the values into the probability formula: *P = 1 - e^(-nσx) = 1 - e^(-5.83 × 10²² × 17 × 10^-24 × 0.2)*. This simplifies to *P = 1 - e^(-0.198)*.\n</step6>\n<step7>\nCalculating this gives us *P ≈ 1 - e^(-0.198) ≈ 1 - 0.820 = 0.180*.

Here, *n* is the number of moles, *R* is the gas constant, and *T* is the temperature.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nAt 298 K, we can calculate the pressure if we know the number of moles of argon. Assuming we have 1 mole, *P = nRT/V*.

The concentration of acetic acid remains 0.05 M since we are diluting it with water.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nNext, we calculate the moles of acetic acid: *moles = concentration × volume*. Thus, moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nAt 25% of the equivalence point, we have added 25% of the moles of NaOH needed to neutralize the acetic acid. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. Therefore, at 25%, we have added 0.00025 moles of NaOH.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nThis means we have 0.001 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of NaOH. The reaction produces acetate ions [ions acétate] and leaves us with 0.00075 moles of acetic acid remaining.

Thus, pH = 4.73 + log(0.00625/0.01875).\n</step6>\n<step7>\nAt the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The pH at this point can be calculated using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate ions, which gives a basic solution. The concentration of acetate ions is 0.0025 M in 0.040 L.\n</step7>\n<step8>\nUsing the Kb for acetate, we can find the pH. Kb = Kw/Ka = 1.0x10^-14 / 1.85x10^-5. This gives us Kb ≈ 5.41x10^-10.

For set X, *X = {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}*, the sum is 350, and there are 7 elements, so the mean is 350/7 = 50.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nNow for set Y, *Y = {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}*, the sum is 350 as well, and with 7 elements, the mean is also 350/7 = 50. Thus, both sets have the same mean: *matsakaicin = 50*.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nNext, we find the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted. For both sets, since they have an odd number of elements, the median is the fourth number in the sorted list. For X, the median is 50, and for Y, it is also 50. So, *matsakaici = 50* for both.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nFinally, we check the mode, which is the number that appears most frequently. In set X, all numbers are unique, so there is no mode. In set Y, again, all numbers are unique, so there is also no mode.

How much copper is produced at the same time?\"\n</step1>\n<step2>\nTo solve this, we need to apply the concept of electrolysis and the stoichiometry of the reactions involved. The reaction for silver deposition from AgNO₃ is: *Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag*.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nFrom the question, we know that 1.273 grams of silver were deposited.

Thus, *n(Ag) = 1.273 g / 107.87 g/mol*.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nCalculating this gives us about 0.0118 moles of silver. According to the electrochemical equivalent, the same amount of charge that deposits silver will also reduce copper ions in the CuSO₄ cell: *Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu*.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nFor every mole of copper deposited, 2 moles of electrons are required. Therefore, the moles of copper produced will be half the moles of silver: *n(Cu) = n(Ag) / 2*.\n</step5>\n<step6>\nNow, we can calculate the mass of copper produced using its molar mass (approximately 63.55 g/mol): *mass(Cu) = n(Cu) × 63.55 g/mol*.\n</step6>\n<step7>\nSubstituting the values, we find that the mass of copper produced is approximately 0.3749 grams.\n</step7></thinking>", "answer": "<answer>0.3749g</answer>", "language": "Hausa"}

Initially, the body is at rest, so its momentum is zero — *momentum na jikin yana daidai da sifili*.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nWhen the gamma photon is emitted, it carries momentum, given by the formula: *p = E/c*, where E is the energy of the photon and c is the speed of light.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nThus, the momentum of the emitted gamma photon is *p_gamma = E_gamma/c*. For the body to conserve momentum, it must gain an equal and opposite momentum — *jikin zai sami karfin juyawa na akasin p_gamma*.\n</step4>\n<step5>\nLet the recoil momentum of the body be *p_recoil = M * v_recoil*, where v_recoil is the recoil velocity. Setting these equal gives us: *M * v_recoil = E_gamma/c*.\n</step5>\n<step6>\nFrom this, we can solve for the recoil velocity: *v_recoil = E_gamma/(M * c)*. The kinetic energy of the body after the emission is given by *KE = (1/2) M v_recoil^2*.\n</step6>\n<step7>\nSubstituting for v_recoil, we find: *KE = (1/2) M (E_gamma/(M * c))^2 = (E_gamma^2)/(2Mc^2)*.\n</step7>\n<step8>\nTherefore, the recoil energy of the body after the emission of the gamma photon is expressed as: *kuzarin dawowa na jiki = (E_gamma^2)/(2Mc^2)*.\n</step8></thinking>", "answer": "<answer>Kuzarin dawowa na jiki bayan fitarwar hasken gamma shine (E_gamma^2)/(2Mc^2).</answer>", "language": "Hausa"}

In level flight, the lift must equal the weight of the aircraft, which is 18,000 lbf. The lift equation is given by: *L = C_L * (0.5 * ρ * V² * S)*, where *L* is lift, *C_L* is the lift coefficient, *ρ* is the air density, *V* is the velocity, and *S* is the wing area.\n</step2>\n<step3>\nWe know the air density *ρ* is 0.076 lbm/ft³, the velocity *V* is 230 ft/sec, and the wing area *S* is 320 ft². Plugging these values into the lift equation, we can rearrange it to solve for the lift coefficient: *C_L = L / (0.5 * ρ * V² * S)*.\n</step3>\n<step4>\nCalculating the right side, we first find *0.5 * ρ * V²*: *0.5 * 0.076 * (230)²*.

The drag coefficient *C_D* is given as 0.055, and the total drag is 1.75 times the drag from the wings alone. We can find the drag force using the equation: *D = C_D * (0.5 * ρ * V² * S)*, and then multiply by 1.75 to find the total drag.\n</step5>\n<step6>\nFinally, the required forward thrust must equal the total drag to maintain level flight.
